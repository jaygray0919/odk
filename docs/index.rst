Ontology Development Kit Guide
==============================

This guide is intended for maintainers and editors of OBO ontologies.

The first part of the guide is how to set up a new ontology project.
This requires some technical steps.

The second part of the guide is for day to day editing.

**NOTE** this guide is adapted from the GO editors guide.
Some instructions may still be GO-specific.
